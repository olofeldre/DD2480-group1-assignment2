<H3>Show the latest build</H3>

Property (core CI feature #3 - notification): the CI server supports notification of CI results. At least one notification mechanism of the following list is implemented:

Commit status: the CI server sets the commit status (Länkar till en externa sida.) on the repository (REST API (Länkar till en externa sida.)n for Github)
Email: the CI server sends an email to the project member about the build result.
Preparation: The students document in the README how notification has been implemented and unit-tested.

Assessment: The grader observes the status of the change made while assessing P2. Optionally, the grader may look at the implementation or the tests of this feature.<P>

<H4>Requirements for P+: Keeping track of build history</H4>

Property (CI feature): the CI server keeps the history of the past builds. This history persists even if the server is rebooted. Each build is given a unique URL, that is accessible to get the build information (commit identifier, build date, build logs). One URL exists to list all builds.

Preparation: the students document the build list URL in the README.

Assessment: The grader opens the build list URL by clicking on it in the README. The grader randomly clicks on a build and assesses the appropriateness of the information.<P>
